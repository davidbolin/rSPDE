Description: Functions that compute rational approximations of fractional elliptic stochastic partial differential equations. The package also contains functions for common statistical usage of these approximations. The main reference for the methods is Bolin and Kirchner (2020) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1665537>, which can be generated by the citation function in R.
